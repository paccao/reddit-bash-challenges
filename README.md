### Challenges

1. Write a script that records in a log all the processes launched after the script and specifies their parent.
2. Edit recursively all the name of the files in a directory changing the uppercase letters to lowercase.
3. Write a script that continously shows the time with seconds.
4. Write a script that draws a graph of the percentage of CPU used by a process, given a PID as an argument. Also, give the option to specify the size of the sampling as an argument.
5. Write a script that checks all the directories specified by the user for files that are duplicates, even if they have a different name.
6. A disk in which we need to copy a big number of files is broken and throws an error when it's used for more than X seconds. To avoid getting an error, we have to write a script that copies a directory in another one stopping for A seconds every B seconds.
